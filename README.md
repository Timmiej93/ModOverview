# ModOverview
This repo is not for any form of development, it simply shows what I'm currently working on and what I'm planning to do.

## How does this list work?
A description of what all priorities etc. mean.

* **High priority**

   These are mods I'm currently finishing, working on releasing them.

* **Medium priority**

   All mods that are next in line for completion. These mods will transfer to high priority as soon as other high priority mods are finished.
   
* **Low priority**

   These mods still need a lot of work and/or research, and will probably not be released / worked on until I have a breakthrough in something I'm stuck on.

* **Mod ideas**

   These mods are still only ideas, with no implementation thus far yet.

## Mod ideas
* **Combine Header Fix**

   A combine header can pick up loose straw and poop it out of its back (probably at 90% of what went in, to prevent using it as a straw swather). It can also cut grass, and poop that out of its back, mixed with straw, making the swath virtually unusable. To prevent using a combine as a mower, the grass will come out at a heavily reduced yield (40% / 50%). This mod could enable you to create neater headlands, and also stimulates you to top/mow the grass around your crops before you harvest your crop.

* **Crop Density Simulation**

   A combine's harvest speed depends on the fertilisation level of the crop it's harvesting.
   
* **Remove Harvesting Speed Limit**

   Instead of a hard speed limit, you can drive as fast as you want. However, driving too fast (depending on density, may be combined with 'Crop Density Simulation') will reduce yield, and potentially leave bits of crop standing. 

* **Manual Igniton for Chainsaw**

   The title says it all, pretty much. Idea courtesy of grassman246899 on FS-UK.

* **Wrapped Bale Puncture thingy**

   Turn a wrapped bale into a wrapped grass bale, or prevent fermenting into silage when using Seasons mod, when its foil is punctured with a balespike. Idea courtesy of WrinkleysRule on FS-UK.

* **Landing Birds After Plowing**

   Animated birds landing on ground you just plowed. Idea courtesy of bnjgray87 on FS-UK.
